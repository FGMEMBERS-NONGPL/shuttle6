Edited 2007-2009 by Stewart Andreason
   All craft dimensions have been corrected to be exactly like
   a Type 6 shuttlecraft:
        Length 6.5m
        Width  4.4m
        Height 2.7m
        Mass   3.38 metric tons

   (except for the placement of the pilot's console relative to the windows.
    I increased the range of vision slightly.)
